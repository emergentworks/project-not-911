## About Not911
Not911 is designed to direct you to New York City-based organizations that offer counseling, mediation and intervention services.

Currently, that means a list of community-based groups that offer preventative services and strategies for issues related to mental health, homelessness, legal aid and other topics.

These are not organizations that should be used in a life-threatening emergency. If someone is experiencing a life-threatening emergency, call 911 immediately.

Not911 is not perfect. It is an MVP, an idea that we hope will gain traction. A potential alternative to the current system.

It is missing many potentially useful features, hotlines, etc, and is currently only available in NYC.

But we want to make it better - that is why we've made it open source. The more the community contributes, the better it will be.
