# project-not-911
Alternatives to calling 911

## Steps to run this project
Assuming you have [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on your machine:

- Install [Expo](https://expo.io/) framework
  ```
  npm install --global expo-cli
  ```
  Expo is a framework and a platform for universal React applications. It is a set of tools and services built around React Native and native platforms that help       you develop, build, deploy, and quickly iterate on iOS, Android, and web apps from the same JavaScript/TypeScript codebase.
- Clone the repository on your machine: `git clone https://github.com/emergentworks/project-not-911.git`
- Navigate to your newly created project folder: `cd project-not-911`
- Install dependencies: `expo install`
- Boot up the app: `npm start (or expo start)`

## About Not911
Not911 is designed to direct you to organizations that offer counseling, mediation and intervention services.

Currently, that means a list of community-based groups that offer preventative services and strategies for issues related to mental health, homelessness, legal aid and other topics.

These are not organizations that should be used in a life-threatening emergency. If someone is experiencing a life-threatening emergency, call 911 immediately.

Not911 is not perfect. It is an MVP, an idea that we hope will gain traction. A potential alternative to the current system.

It is missing many potentially useful features, hotlines, etc, and is currently only available in NYC.

But we want to make it better - that is why we've made it open source. The more the community contributes, the better it will be.
